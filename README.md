# CE2-03-2 Reactor and Controller Design Project

`reactor.m` is the main file. It can be run independently, and will draw constants from `constants.m`(!). `plots.m` does what it says on the tin.

## Notes

- `.slx` files are binary, so `git diff` doesn't workâ€”[use Simulink to compare](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/simulink/ug/merge-simulink-models-from-the-comparison-report.html)
